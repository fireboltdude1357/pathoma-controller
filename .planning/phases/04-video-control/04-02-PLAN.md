<objective>
Verify all 12 playback controls work end-to-end from web app to video player

Purpose: Confirm Phase 4 success criteria before marking complete
Output: Human verification that all PLAY-01 through PLAY-12 requirements are satisfied

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete video control pipeline: web app buttons -> Convex -> service worker -> content script -> HTMLMediaElement API -> video playback
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Setup:
1. Open terminal 1: `cd /Users/tannersharon/Desktop/Personal/pathoma-controller && npm run dev`
2. Open Chrome and load unpacked extension from `extension/` folder (chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode, Load unpacked)
3. Navigate to a video on pcloud.link (e.g., u.pcloud.link with a Pathoma video)
4. Let video load and start playing
5. Open web app in new tab: http://localhost:3000
6. Log in with authorized account

Test each control (12 total):

**Play/Pause (PLAY-01, PLAY-02):**
1. While video is playing, click Pause button -> Video should pause
2. Click Play button -> Video should resume

**Seek Backward (PLAY-03, PLAY-04, PLAY-05, PLAY-06):**
3. Click "-1s" button -> Video should jump back 1 second
4. Click "-5s" button -> Video should jump back 5 seconds
5. Click "-10s" button -> Video should jump back 10 seconds
6. Click "-30s" button -> Video should jump back 30 seconds

**Seek Forward (PLAY-07, PLAY-08, PLAY-09, PLAY-10):**
7. Click "+1s" button -> Video should jump forward 1 second
8. Click "+5s" button -> Video should jump forward 5 seconds
9. Click "+10s" button -> Video should jump forward 10 seconds
10. Click "+30s" button -> Video should jump forward 30 seconds

**Speed Control (PLAY-11, PLAY-12):**
11. Click "- Speed" button -> Playback should slow (check video plays slower)
12. Click "+ Speed" button -> Playback should speed up (check video plays faster)

**Latency check:**
- Commands should execute visibly within ~500ms of clicking button
- No noticeable delay between click and video response

**Console check:**
- Open DevTools on extension service worker (chrome://extensions -> Inspect views: service worker)
- Look for "[Pathoma Controller] New command:" logs when buttons clicked
- Open DevTools on pcloud.link tab
- Look for content script logs when commands received
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all 12 controls work correctly.
If issues found, describe: which control failed, what happened vs expected, any console errors.
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Human confirms all 12 playback controls work as expected.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 12 PLAY requirements (PLAY-01 through PLAY-12) verified working
- Commands execute within 500ms latency
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Extension reliably controls video playback
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-video-control/04-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
