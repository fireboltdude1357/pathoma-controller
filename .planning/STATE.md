## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 0]: Keyboard simulation over direct player API (pending validation in spike)
- [Phase 0]: No status sync (simplifies architecture)
- [Phase 0]: Manual user authorization via Convex dashboard

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 0]: Keyboard simulation may fail due to isTrusted:false events. Spike will validate direct HTMLMediaElement API approach on pcloud.link before full roadmap commitment.
